## Additions

### Commands

|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|

### Items

#### <ins>Big Stick</ins>
![The Big Stick. It's like the normal stick, but Bigger!](readmeAssets/BigStickCraft.gif "echotweaks:big_stick")<br>
Only hits as well as a boring normal stick.<br>
Knocks attacked enemies very far away.<br>
Has 60 durability, loses 1 on attack, 2 on block break

### Advancements

#### <ins>Serious Dedication</ins>

The old one was better!

The vanilla 1.21.5 *Serious&nbsp;Dedication* (`minecraft:husbandry/obtain_netherite_hoe`) has been replaced by *A&nbsp;Heavy&nbsp;Commitment*, and demoted to a `goal` rather than a `challenge`  (see [frame](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Advancement_definition)).

Instead, *Serious&nbsp;Dedication* (now `echotweaks:husbandry/break_netherite_hoe`) is restored to its former glory, requiring you to use up and break the precious tool.

#### <ins>Chestful Of Cobblestone</ins>

That's a lot.

Fill a Chest with exactly 1,728 Cobblestone, and then open it.

(For the uninitiated, just fill a single Chest all the way.)

#### <ins>Diamonds To You</ins>

Sharing is caring.

Have another entity pick up a diamond you have thrown on the ground, Players and Zombies alike.

#### <ins>Fully Furnaced</ins>

That's more.

Fill your Inventory with exactly 2,368 Furnaces.

(Again, no counting is required. You'll know when you're done.)

#### <ins>Flower Power</ins>

They're pretty, right?

This one's simple, have all the Flowers at once.

(Yes I know there are more things with "flower" in them)<br>
(and more things in `#minecraft:flowers`)<br>
(these are the ones that I say count)<br>
(they have petals idk)<br>
(don't @ me)

</details>

#### <ins>Overkill</ins>

You gotta wallk first.

It's just like it was before the new fancy Mace existed. Deal at least 9 hearts of damage in a single hit. *Over-Overkill* is now after this in the tree, but is otherwise unchanged.

#### <ins>Rainbow Collection</ins>

Loud and proud!

Have all 16 differently coloured wool blocks at the same time.

#### <ins>Stack Overflow</ins>

It's too deep!

Have a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle.

(Basically either just do it until you can't anymore, or, if you want to be interesting, get one of every color.)
