### Items

#### <ins>Big Stick</ins>
![The Big Stick. It's like the normal stick, but Bigger!](readmeAssets/BigStickCraft.gif  "echotweaks:big_stick")<br>
Only hits as well as a boring normal stick.<br>
Knocks attacked enemies very far away.<br>
Has 60 durability, loses 1 on attack, 2 on block break

### Advancements

#### <ins>Serious Dedication</ins>

<p>The old one was better!</p>

<p>

The vanilla 1.21.5 *Serious Dedication* (`minecraft:husbandry/obtain_netherite_hoe`) has been replaced by *A&nbsp;Heavy&nbsp;Commitment*, and demoted to a `goal` rather than a `challenge`  (see [frame](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Advancement_definition)).
</p>

<p>

Instead, *Serious Dedication* (now `echotweaks:husbandry/break_netherite_hoe`) is restored to its former glory, requiring you to use up and break the precious tool.
</p>
