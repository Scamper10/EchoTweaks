## Dependencies & Relations
EchoTweaks **needs** [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files/6351756) to function fully.

It also supports [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/files/6347337), which is recommended for access to the config screen.

## Additions

### Commands

#### <ins>Heal</ins>
```
heal [<entity>] [<amount>]
```
Heals `entity` by `amount` health points.  
\- If `entity` is omitted, targets the executing entity.  
\- If `amount` is omitted, restores max health.

#### <ins>Platform</ins>
```
platform [<main_block>|$use_held] [<size>] [<center_block>]
```
Fills `main_block` (or the block in your hand) in a square around you.<br>
\- Uses config if no arguments are given, or if `size` is missing.<br>
\- Each `size` correlates to a square of side-length `2*size + 1` centred on the player.

#### <ins>Unbreakable</ins>
```
unbreakable
```
Applies the `minecraft:unbreakable` component to the player's currently held item.

### Items

#### <ins>Big Stick</ins>
![The Big Stick. You craft it with 3 Planks placed vertically. It's like the normal stick, but Bigger!](readmeAssets/BigStickCraft.gif "echotweaks:big_stick")<br>
Only hits as well as a boring normal stick.<br>
Knocks attacked enemies very far away.<br>
Has 60 durability, loses 1 on attack, 2 on block break

#### <ins>Wrench</ins>
![The Wrench. You craft it with 3 Iron Ingots placed diagonally. It's got a handle bit and a claw bit. That's it. It's useless. Move on.](readmeAssets/WrenchCraft.png "echotweaks:wrench")<br>
Is purely cosmetic, can be crafted back down into three ingots.

### Blocks

#### <ins>Charcoal Block</ins>
![The Charcoal Block. It's pretty similar-looking to a normal Coal Block. Maybe a bit lighter and brown-er, like Charcoal is to Coal.](readmeAssets/CharcoalBlock.png)<br>
Functionally identical to the vanilla Coal Block, but for Charcoal.<br>
Also smelts the same 80 items.

#### <ins>A Cacophonous Chorus</ins>

"A Cacophonous Chorus"

Tame all 5 different colors of parrot

#### <ins>A Dense Octette</ins>

It sure is... sound.

Use all 8 differently-sounding Goat Horns.

#### <ins>Serious Dedication</ins>

The old one was better!

The vanilla 1.21.5 *Serious&nbsp;Dedication* (`minecraft:husbandry/obtain_netherite_hoe`) has been replaced by *A&nbsp;Heavy&nbsp;Commitment*, and demoted to a `goal` rather than a `challenge` (see [frame](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Advancement_definition)).

Instead, *Serious&nbsp;Dedication* (now `echotweaks:husbandry/break_netherite_hoe`) is restored to its former glory, requiring you to use up and break the precious tool.

#### <ins>Chestful Of Cobblestone</ins>

That's a lot.

Fill a single Chest with exactly 1,728 Cobblestone, and then open it.

(For the uninitiated, just fill a single Chest all the way.)

#### <ins>Diamonds To You</ins>

Sharing is caring.

Have another entity pick up a diamond you have thrown on the ground, Players and Zombies alike.

#### <ins>Full Circle</ins>

Slayyyyy!

Kill the Ender Dragon 20 times.<br>
(You must get kill credit yourself. Gateways are not actually linked to this advancement.)

#### <ins>Fully Furnaced</ins>

That's more.

Fill your Inventory with exactly 2,368 Furnaces.

(Again, no counting is required. You'll know when you're done.)

#### <ins>Flower Power</ins>

They're pretty, right?

This one's simple, have all the Flowers at once.

(these are the ones that I say count)<br>
(they have petals idk)<br>
(don't @ me)

</details>

#### <ins>One with the Wild</ins>

Gotta catch'em all!

Tame everything that is tameable, be trusted by everything that can trust, and ride every (living or undead) thing that can be ridden.

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;(Here's the list)</summary>

```
minecraft:camel (ride)
minecraft:cat (tame)
minecraft:donkey (tame)
minecraft:fox (breed)
minecraft:horse (tame)

minecraft:mule (tame)
minecraft:ocelot (tame*)
minecraft:parrot (tame)
minecraft:pig (ride)
minecraft:skeleton_horse (ride)
minecraft:strider (ride)
minecraft:wolf (tame)
```

\* Ocelots cannot be tamed, but the can gain player "Trust" in a similar way
</details>

#### <ins>Overkill</ins>

You gotta wallk first.

It's just like it was before the new fancy Mace existed. Deal at least 9 hearts of damage in a single hit. *Over-Overkill* is now after this in the tree, but is otherwise unchanged.

#### <ins>Rainbow Collection</ins>

Loud and proud!

Have all 16 differently coloured wool blocks at the same time.

#### <ins>Stack Overflow</ins>

It's too deep!

Have a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle inside a Bundle.

(Basically either just do it until you can't anymore, or, if you want to be interesting, get one of every color.)

#### <ins>The Lie</ins>

You will be baked. And then there will be cake.

Get together all the ingredients, combine then in just the right way, et voil√†! A cake.

#### <ins>You Monster</ins>

Eh. It was bound to happen.

Crush a turtle egg.

#### <ins>Zoology</ins>

The world is full of life!

Breed animals 5 times.

This is a root advancement - It creates its own tab.

## Changes

### Advancements

#### <ins>Total Beelocation</ins>
The game now correctly grants the advancement with Beehives, as well as Bee Nests.

### Recipes

> This section details new recipes involving vanilla items. Modded recipes are detailed in their respective items' sections.</span>

#### <ins>Dead Bush</ins>
![You can smelt a Bush to obtain a Dead Bush.](readmeAssets/BushSmelt.png)<br>
This makes Dead Bushes renewable.

### Visual

![The icon that shows where a hidden advancement would be. It's a lil' octagoon-ish thing with a question mark.](src/main/resources/assets/echotweaks/textures/gui/sprites/hinter.png)<br>
Hidden Advancements will now show a small icon in their place in the advancement tree. This allows the player to know when they still have advancements to complete.

### Swamp Oaks

When an Oak Sapling grows near swamp blocks, it will grow into a vanilla [Swamp Oak](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Oak#Swamp_Oak).

This is guaranteed if and only if a block in `#echotweaks:grows_swamp_oaks` is present in a 5x3x5 area around the sapling. By default, Lily Pads and Vines.
