New Advancements:
	Coral Corral	- All living Coral blocks
	Varied Dairy	- Milk each different cow variant
	Pro Bono		- Kill each different skeleton variant
	..... A Head	- All Heads
	............	- All overworld Ores (including DEO)
	-- Others for Encounter EVERY mob variant (get colored egg, ride pig, etc)
Changed Advancements:
	Fix `Caves & Cliffs` so breaking bedrock is not sometimes needed
	Fix `This Boat has Legs` so it doesn't require a carrot-stick click, just holding one
	move appropriate 100% advancements to zoology (Complete Catalogue, Whole Pack)
	Way to view completed requirements/criteria like in BaC (with translations keys?)
	Grey out completed advancement tabs and move them to the end of the list
		(AdvancementTabType and AdvancementTab, textures are hardcoded to be dependant on if the tab is selected)
	F3+H shows hovered advancement ids like item ids
	? A criterion that mutates itself into pick up all blocks (vanilla criteria) when resources are loaded

Per-Player phantoms (invisible to others, won't attack others)
	^ can't find a way to link spawn-causing player when entity is created
Disable phantoms for Creative players

Villager inventory management
- gifting/stealing (with gossips)
	add button to trading menu? (would require villager to have a profession)
	or gift via bundle? how steal?

Crop replanting
Quick composting
More jungle saplings, dark oak too?

Button to toggle tick pausing in the pause/advancement menus

	Remove item use cooldowns (insta crossbow?)
	Fix jukebox spitting out duplicate discs (don't spit if held is same?)
	Infinite sponge (configurable size?) (don't tick surrounding water?)

? Datapack modifiers, rather than replacing whole files
	In a modifier file, target using id
	(Can replace record classes by making a new one and using that instead of the vanilla)
	Need options for append ( applies to {} or [] or maybe "" ) or replace (applies to any type)
	Possible format example: `{  "criteria/<criterion>/conditions/damage/dealt/min": 50.0  ,  "echotweaks:append": true  }`
	Append would default false
	Might need to implement `\/` -> "/" and `\\` -> "\"

	/whereis <player> [<face towards>] - get coords and optionally tp ~ ~ ~ facing (need cheats)
		- config: give compass? display coords? client-only glowing? display distance? (compass tells distance?)
		- could maybe also be /locate player ... but that might be harder/impossible
