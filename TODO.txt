New Advancements:
	............	- All Heads
Changed Advancements:
	Fix `Caves & Cliffs` so breaking bedrock is not sometimes needed
	Fix `This Boat has Legs` so it doesn't require a carrot-stick click, just holding one
	move appropriate 100% advancements to zoology (Catalogue, Pack)
	Way to view completed requirements/criteria like in BaC (with translations keys?)
	Grey out completed advancement tabs and move them to the right side of the list
	F3+H shows hovered advancement ids like item ids

Villager inventory management
- gifting/stealing (with gossips)
	add button to trading menu? (would require villager to have a profession)
	or gift via bundle? how steal?

Quick composting
More jungle saplings, dark oak too?

Button to toggle tick pausing in the pause/advancement menus

Creative
	Instakill weapon
	Insta-tame
	Block updater tool
	Remove item cooldowns (insta crossbow?)
	Fix jukebox spitting out duplicate discs (don't spit if held is same?)
	Infinite sponge (configurable size?)

Datapack modifiers, rather than replacing whole files
	Use datapaack directory structure (eg `<some modifier folder>/advancement/husbandry/<some vanilla advancement>.json`)
	Also add a namedModifiers file, which lists paths relative to `<modifier folder>` to a `<some named modifier>.json`
	Need options for append ( {} or [] or maybe "" ) or replace (any type)
	Possible format example: `{  "criteria/<criterion>/conditions/damage/dealt/min": 50.0  ,  "echotweaks:append": true  }`
	Append would default false
	Might need to implement `\/` -> "/" and `\\` -> "\"

BugFix - Ocelots sometimes take fish from client when feed requirements not met

Commands
